 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;1, 2015, Philip Morris International Inc. (&#147;PMI&#148;) entered into a credit agreement (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) relating to a
senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#147;Facility&#148;) with the lenders named therein, Citibank International Limited, as facility agent, and Citibank, N.A., as swingline agent. The Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate
principal amount of US$3.5 billion (or the equivalent in Euro) and expires on October&nbsp;1, 2020, unless extended as further described in the Credit Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interest rates on borrowings under the Facility will be based on prevailing interest rates for U.S. Dollars or Euro, as applicable, and as further described
in the Credit Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Facility will be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of an EBITDA to interest
ratio, as defined therein, of not less than 3.5 to 1.0. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default customary for credit facilities of this
type (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including nonpayment of principal or interest when due; material incorrectness of representations and warranties when made; breach of covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency; unsatisfied ERISA
obligations; unstayed material judgment beyond specified periods; acceleration or payment default of other material indebtedness; and invalidation of PMI&#146;s guaranty. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, the outstanding loans may be accelerated and the lenders&#146;
commitments may be terminated. The occurrence of the bankruptcy and insolvency event of default will result in the automatic termination of commitments and acceleration of outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of the lenders and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory,
commercial and investment banking services for PMI, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain affiliates of the lenders are underwriters of certain of PMI&#146;s note issuances. PMI and some of its subsidiaries may
enter into foreign exchange and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, certain of the lenders and their respective affiliates act as dealers in connection with PMI&#146;s commercial paper
programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Facility replaces PMI&#146;s existing US$3.5 billion (or the equivalent in Euro) revolving credit facility with the lenders named therein
and Citibank International Limited, as facility agent, and Citibank, N.A., as swingline agent, which was to expire on October&nbsp;25, 2016 (the &#147;Terminated Facility&#148;). The Terminated Facility was terminated effective October&nbsp;1, 2015.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At October&nbsp;1, 2015, PMI had no borrowings outstanding under the Terminated Facility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated
herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Item&nbsp;1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. </B></P>
